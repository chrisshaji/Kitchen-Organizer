# Kitchen-Organizer
A customized and portable Kitchen utensil organizer.

## Design Rationale
My friend had reached out to me to ask me if I could make a drawer for his kitchen to hold all of his spatulas and cookware. We decided on 3-d printing one as
it would be very cost-effective, and easy to fabricate. 
One major constraint we had to keep in mind was the size of the drawer. Since we wanted the holder to fit nice and snug in the drawer, it had to be about the length 
of the drawer which was about 15 inches. We had to do some thinking in order to fabricate this as it was too big for any 3d printer to print in one piece. We brainstormed
and finally ended up with breaking the holder into two pieces and connecting them using snap in joints.

Desinging the snap in joints was harder than expected. We experimented with number of snap in joints, length, number of hooks, etc. Initially, we went for four snap in
joints, but after testing, it proved to be hard to disconect once joined, so we decided on using two snap in joints on either side as shown below. It was 3-d printed using PLA, 
10 percent infill, 3 wall, and tree supports.
