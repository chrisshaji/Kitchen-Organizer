# Kitchen-Organizer
A customized and portable Kitchen utensil organizer.

## Design Rationale
My friend had reached out to me to ask me if I could make a drawer for his kitchen to hold all of his spatulas and cookware. We decided on 3-d printing one as
it would be very cost-effective, and easy to fabricate. 
One major constraint we had to keep in mind was the size of the drawer. Since we wanted the holder to fit nice and snug in the drawer, it had to be about the length 
of the drawer which was about 15 inches.
